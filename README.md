# McCabe++ (mcpp)

<img src="media/mcpp.jpeg" height=400/>

`mcpp` measures typical code complexity metrics like McCabe's cyclomatic
complexity.

The goal of this project is to provide a re-usable script to analyze C/C++
source code and extract complexity metrics from it.

## Complexity Metrics

| Dimension            | ID | Metric Description             |    |
|----------------------|----|--------------------------------|----|
| CD1: Function        | C1 | cyclomatic complexity          | ✅ |
| CD2: Loop Structures | C2 | number of loops                | ✅ |
|                      | C3 | number of nested loops         | ✅ |
|                      | C4 | maximum nesting level of loops | ✅ |

## Vulnerability Metrics

## Setup

```sh
pip install -e .
```

## Usage

```sh
setup       # build tree-sitter libs
```

Configuration parameters can be changed in `config.yaml` or directly on the CLI
with e.g. `someCmd paths.out_root=some/dir`.
